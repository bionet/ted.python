Time Encoding and Decoding Toolkit
==================================

Package Description
-------------------
The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolkit contains Python implementations
of algorithms designed to reversibly convert digitally sampled signals
to and from a time-domain representation consisting of a series of
time intervals between fixed-amplitude spikes. Sample code
demonstrating the use of the implementations is included.

Development
-----------
The latest source code can be obtained from
