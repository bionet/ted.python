Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Introduction
------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox (TED) is a library of Python
routines, classes, and demo programs that implement time encoding and
decoding algorithms. Implementations of the toolbox for other languages such as 
`Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_ 
and NVIDIA's `CUDA <http://www.nvidia.com/cuda/>`_ are also available
from the Bionet Group's `code repository page
<http://bionet.ee.columbia.edu/code/>`_. 

To get started using the toolbox, go to the :doc:`installation <install>` page and
try running the demos. Check out the :doc:`overview <overview>` page for a
high-level introduction to time encoding and decoding concepts.
