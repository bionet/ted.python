Time Domain Coding Toolbox
==========================

The Time Domain Coding Toolbox contains Python implementations of
algorithms designed to reversibly convert finite-length, band-limited,
digitally sampled signals to and from a time-domain representation
consisting of a series of time intervals between fixed-amplitude
spikes. Sample code demonstrating the use of the implementations is
included.

Authors & Acknowledgements
==========================

The implementations in this package were written by Lev Givon,
currently at the Bionet Group [1] at Columbia University. Some parts
of the code are based (in part) on previous implementations written by
the following members of the Bionet Group:

Eftychios Pnevmatikakis
Yevgeniy Slutskiy
Robert Turetsky

Special thanks are due to the following Bionet Group members for 
reviewing the code and providing useful suggestions:

Robert Turetsky
Yiyin Zhou

All of the time encoding and decoding algorithms currently comprised
by the toolbox were developed by Aurel Lazar [2], currently at
Columbia University's Electrical Engineering Department.
