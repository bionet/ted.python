Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Package Description
-------------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox contains Python implementations of
algorithms designed to reversibly convert band-limited, digitally sampled
signals to and from a time-domain representation consisting of a series of time
intervals between fixed-amplitude spikes. Sample code demonstrating the use of
the implementations is included.

Future releases of this package (and other software written by members
of the Bionet Group at Columbia University) can be obtained from

http://bionet.ee.columbia.edu/code/

Authors & Acknowledgments
--------------------------

The implementations in this package were written by Lev Givon [1]_,
currently at the Bionet Group at Columbia University. Some parts
of the code are based (in part) on previous implementations written by
the following members of the Bionet Group:

* Eftychios Pnevmatikakis
* Yevgeniy Slutskiy
* Robert Turetsky

Special thanks are due to the following Bionet Group members for 
reviewing the code and providing useful suggestions:

* Robert Turetsky
* Yiyin Zhou

All of the time encoding and decoding algorithms currently comprised
by the toolbox were developed by Aurel Lazar [2]_, currently at
Columbia University's Electrical Engineering Department.
