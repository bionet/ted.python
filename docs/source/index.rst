Time Encoding and Decoding Toolkit
==================================

Introduction
------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolkit (TED) is a library of Python
routines, classes, and demo programs that implement time encoding and
decoding algorithms. A  
`MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_  implementation of the
toolbox is also available from the Bionet Group's `code repository page
<http://bionet.github.io/>`_.  

Additional algorithms for encoding and decoding video signals implemented in 
Python are available in the `Video Time Encoding and Decoding Toolkit 
<vtem.rtfd.org>`_.

To get started using the toolbox, go to the :doc:`installation <install>` page and
try running the demos. Check out the :doc:`overview <overview>` page for a
high-level introduction to time encoding and decoding concepts.
